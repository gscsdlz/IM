# IM
This is a instant message program with linux-c/c++ socket
This IM program don not have a beautiful UI, just use the Terminal.(..◜ᴗ◝..)
Include server.c and client.c file

# Development Environment: Ubuntu 16.04
# IDE: CodeBlocks16.01

In the next version, Maybe I will write a client.c based on the Windows platform

# Function:
1. Use the C/S mode, it can easily through NAT while the client is under the LAN
2. Support group communication
3. Support person-to-person communication

My poor English, who can saved me? o(╥﹏╥)o
